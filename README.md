# A sweater with some letters on it

And some lights to indicate which letter the wearer wishes to communicate at the moment.

All resemblance to Netflix-owned television shows is purely a form of flattery.

# Assembly notes

- This design requires a 250Ohm resistor (nominally a 246Ohm resistor), since each LED has a forward voltage of 2.1V and a test current of 30mA, and the battery has a supply voltage of around 9.5V (nominally 9V) ((9.5V - 2.1V)/0.03A = 246Ohms).  250Ohm resistors cost quite a bit more than 4 100Ohm resistors.  I paired two 100Ohm resistors in parallel to make a 50Ohm resistor, then placed it in series with two more 100Ohm resistors to make 250Ohms.  I did not account for the resistance in the wiring or the switches.
- See directory full of photos for other information on construction.
- Zipties were looped around the LEDs to hold them into their sockets
- It's much easier to get the LEDs to seat properly in their sockets if you trim the leads to an even length first.
